          How did you decide what content and images to use for your site plan?
          How did you communicate with your developer? Was there any issues with
          communication? Did your developer meet your expectations for your
          site? What will you do differently next time you hire a team to do a
          project for you?

          How did you manage your development team and comunicate the tasks for
          your junior devs? How did you communicate with your client? Was there
          any issues? How did you handle publishing your clients site and
          sharing it with the client? How was your experience with managing your
          site with GitHub?

          you know what was expected of you for each site? Were you able to
          contribute to your sites? Did you run into any issues with GitHub and
          adding your changes to the sites?

          What was the most challenging part of this project for you? Were you
          able to overcome it? What did you enjoy most about this project? What
          would you do differently if you could do the project again? Do you
          feel more confident in working on real-world projects after this
          experience? Explain.
