          I decided what content and images I wanted to use on my site by
          following my elevator pitch idea to have a gaming hub. The content was
          chosen to be simple and to the point to help avoid confusion. I tried
          communicating with my developer over Microsoft Teams, but there were
          some issues with messages not being seen. My expectations were not
          met, but at least there was some semblance of a website trying to
          follow my wireframe. Next time I hire a team to do a project for me, I
          will try to establish communication better and check in to ensure that
          things are going as planned.<br />

          I communicated with my junior developers through Microsoft Teams. I
          invited them to work on specific sub-pages of the main site.
          Communication with the client was done in class. The only issues came
          from the junior developers not pushing their changes to the GitHub
          repo and not responding to messages. The client's site was published
          through GitHub Pages by merging all changes into the main branch.
          Managing the site with GitHub was smooth and simple due to my previous
          experience using similar version control systems.<br />

          How did you communicate with your team lead? Was there any issues? Did
          you know what was expected of you for each site? Were you able to
          contribute to your sites? Did you run into any issues with GitHub and
          adding your changes to the sites? I communicated with my team leads
          through Microsoft Teams. In one case, there were no issues. In another
          case, I could not get into the GitHub repository at all. I knew what
          was expected of me clearly in the first case; in the second case, I
          had the wireframe but assigned myself a page to work on. The only
          issue I ran into with GitHub was not being able to access the
          repository in the second case.<br />

          The most challenging part of this project was having to coordinate and
          communicate with multiple different teams. I tried to overcome it by
          setting up group chats on Teams, but it was difficult to get
          responses. I enjoyed using my knowledge to make cool-looking websites
          for my classmates. If I could do the project again, I would try to
          establish better communication at the start of the project. I do feel
          more confident in working on real-world projects after this; it helped
          me learn about the importance of communication in team projects.
